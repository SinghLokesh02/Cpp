#include is preprocessor directive which tells the compiler to include the code from specified file like we have "#include<iostream>" means include the code from the iostream file like all the functions etc.

In C++, the "using" keyword is used to declare a using declaration or a using directive, which allows you to use names from a namespace without having to qualify them with the namespace name every time.

The "std" namespace in C++ contains a lot of useful functions and classes for performing input/output operations, manipulating strings, and more. In order to use these functions and classes in your C++ program, you need to either explicitly qualify them with the "std::" prefix, or you can use the "using namespace std;" directive to tell the compiler to use the "std" namespace for all names that are not otherwise declared.

For example, if you want to use the "cout" and "endl" functions from the "std" namespace in your C++ program, you would normally have to use them like this:
*/
int main()
{
    /*
    In C++, the "main" function is a special function that serves as the entry point for the program. When you run a C++ program, the operating system calls the "main" function to start executing the program.

    The program code that you write in the "main" function typically consists of a sequence of statements that perform some computation or I/O operation. When the "main" function finishes executing, it should return an integer value to indicate whether the program completed successfully or not. By convention, a return value of 0 indicates successful completion, and a non-zero value indicates an error.
